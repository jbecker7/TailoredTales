Extensive reading is a highly effective approach to language learning that involves reading a large quantity of authentic texts in the target language. This approach is especially beneficial for language learners who are trying to improve their reading comprehension, vocabulary, and grammar skills.

However, a major problem with extensive reading is accessibility. Many learners may not have access to high-quality reading material in their target language, which can make it difficult for them to engage in extensive reading. This is particularly true for learners who may not have the financial resources to purchase books or access to libraries with a wide selection of language learning materials.

TailoredTales is a webapp that seeks to remedy this problem by leveraging cutting-edge AI to generate content that is tailored to students' level interests.
